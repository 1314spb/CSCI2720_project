## Installation

1. Clone the repository

2. Navigate to the client directory and install React dependencies:
```
cd client
npm install
```
3. Navigate to the server directory and install Express dependencies:
```
cd ../server
npm install
```
## Building the React App
1. Navigate to the client directory:
```
cd client
```
2. Build the React app:
```
npm run build
```
This command generates the static files in the dist directory.

## Running the Express Server
1. Navigate back to the server directory:
```
cd ../server
```
2. Start the Express server:
```
node app.js
```
The server will start and listen on the specified port (default is 3000).

3. Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```
You should see your React application served by the Express server.
